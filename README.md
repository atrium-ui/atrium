## Use in other projects

See [Installation](https://sv.pages.s-v.de/sv-frontend-library/mono/guides/installation/) in the docs for instructions.

<br />

## Packages

### @sv/mono

This package contains all components and templates. It is also used for tooling and development, for example, the cli is located here.

### @sv/elements

The elements package distributes all the custom-elements that are used in the components or external projects.

### @sv/cli

This package is **not** published. It contains the cli which is used from the **@sv/mono** package and only contains executable JavaScript.

**Dependencies**

All elements share the same dependencies from the [elements/package.json](elements/package.json).

## Development

### Prerequisites

See [./.rtx.toml](./.rtx.toml) for tools and versions used in this project.

Currently:

- [task](https://taskfile.dev/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [bun](https://bun.sh/)

They can be installed using [rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx) with `rtx install` in the root directory of this project.
This will also happen automatically when running `task docs` for the first time.

### Getting Started

Run dev server for docs website:

```shell
task docs
```

### Quick setup

```
git clone git@gitlab.s-v.de:sv-components/mono.git && cd mono && task docs
```

### Other commands

Build all packages:

```shell
task build
```

Build docs:

```shell
task docs:build
```

Init new component:

```shell
task new
```

### Building elements

Since all elements are written in TypeScript, they need to be compiled to JavaScript.
All the elements share the same build system. We use [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to generate light weight bundles.

The tsup configuration is located in the package.json of each element.


### Publishing packages

Package publishing is handles by the CI.

The **develop** branch always publishes a prerelease packages. When developing features, it is recommended to work in a feature branch.

When develop is merged into the **main** branch, the docs will be automatically built and deplyed to pages.
That pipeline will also give the options to publish a *patch* or *minor* release of the packages.
