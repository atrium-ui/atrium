title: Accordion

import { AccordionDemo } from "./accordion/AccordionDemo.jsx";
import AccordionDemoCode from "./accordion/AccordionDemo.jsx?raw";
import { Example, Atrium, ComponentHeader } from "package:/components";

<ComponentHeader name="Accordion">
 <Atrium slot="pills" label="a-expandable" href="/atrium/elements/a-expandable" />

 An array of expandable elements.
</ComponentHeader>

## Behaviour

When the accordion is opened or closed, the component makes sure it does not slip out of the viewport by srolling into the viewport.

## Example

<Example code={AccordionDemoCode}>
  <AccordionDemo client:only="vue" />
</Example>
