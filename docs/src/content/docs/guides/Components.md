Copy-pastable components to get started quickly using Tailwind and JSX.

After installing the core library with

```bash
npm install @sv/mono
```

Copy ready to use component with tailwind styling into your project:

```bash
npx atrium use accordion
```

Then customize the component yourself in \*/components/accordion.tsx
