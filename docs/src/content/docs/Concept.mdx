import { AccordionDemo } from "./components/accordion/AccordionDemo";

This library serves as a place to collect and share code between projects and developers.

It includes libraries, web-components and components designed to be independent of any specific framework for use in website creation and provides tooling to build and publish packages.

The components in this library are composed of two layers:

- The first layer are **[Components](./components)**. they ready to use, framework specific and pre-styled Components that give you a solid starting point. You do not import Components as dependencies, they are copied into your projects codebase like templates.

- The second layer is the **[Elements](./elements)** layer. Elements are "Headless" custom-elements that only implement behavior with accessibility in mind, with as little styling as possible.

<div class="not-content max-w-[800px]">
  <p>
    For example, this Accordion **Vue** Component, uses the `<a-expandable/>` custom-element to implement the animated expanding behaviour.
  </p>
  <AccordionDemo class="pt-4" client:only="vue" />
</div>

<br/>

This approach gives the given project ownership over the components design. We start with sensible defaults, then change the design for the projects needs.
