The Datepicker provides an intuitive way for users to select dates through a text input paired with a calendar popover. It combines the [Input](/components/input) component with the [a-calendar](/elements/a-calendar) element to create a seamless date selection experience.

<ContentTabs labels={["Preview", "Code"]}>
  <Story id="datepicker--default" />
  <Code lang="tsx" code={datepickerCode} class="max-h-[600px] overflow-auto" />
</ContentTabs>

## Examples with context

### List Filter

Use a datepicker to filter lists by date ranges, making it easy for users to narrow down results to a specific time period.

<Story id="datepicker--FilterableSidebar" />

### Forms

Integrate the datepicker into forms where date input is required, such as booking systems or event scheduling.

<Story id="datepicker--BookingForm" />

## Accessibility

- The calendar popover can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys
- Pressing Enter or Space selects the focused date
- The calendar supports custom locales via the `locale` attribute
