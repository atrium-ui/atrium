When the accordion is opened or closed, the component makes sure it does not slip out of the viewport by srolling into the viewport.

<Story id="accordion--default" />

### Initially opened

<Story id="accordion--opened" />

## Accessibility

- Each accordion header is a button element that controls the visibility of its associated content region.
- The content region is marked with `aria-labelledby` pointing to the corresponding header button.
- Keyboard interactions:
  - Users can navigate between accordion headers using the Tab key.
  - Users can toggle the visibility of the content region using the Enter or Space key when the
    header button is focused.
- Focusable elements within the content region are only accessible when the accordion item is expanded.
- The accordion will expand, when navigating to an anchor within the content.
- When an accordion item is expanded or collapsed, the component ensures that the focused header remains visible within the viewport.
