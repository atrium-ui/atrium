import { Story } from "package:/components/docs";

The Dialog component displays content in a modal overlay, centered on the screen.

### Default Dialog

<Story id="dialog--default" />

### Confirmation

<Story id="dialog--Confirmation" />

### Form Dialog

<Story id="dialog--FormDialog" />

## Guidelines

Dialogs should be used for:

- Confirming critical actions that require user attention
- Displaying important alerts or notifications

Always provide a clear way to close the dialog and ensure the primary action is obvious.

## Accessibility

- The dialog has proper focus management, focus moves to the dialog when opened and returns to the trigger element when closed
- The dialog is marked with appropriate ARIA attributes (`role="dialog"` or `role="alertdialog"`)
- Color should never used to communicate important information
