A tabs component that organizes content into multiple panels, allowing users to navigate between different sections without leaving the page. Built on the `a-tabs` element, it provides full keyboard navigation, accessibility features, and browser find-in-page support.

## Examples

### Basic Tabs

Click on tabs to switch between panels. Use arrow keys to navigate between tabs when focused.

<Story id="tabs--default" />

### Many Tabs

When there are many tabs, the tab list can scroll horizontally. The layout remains functional and accessible.

<Story id="tabs--manytabs" />

## Guidelines

- **Content Organization**: Use tabs to organize related content that doesn't need to be viewed simultaneously.
- **Tab Labels**: Keep tab labels short and descriptive (1-2 words when possible).
- **Tab Count**: Limit to 3-7 tabs for optimal usability. Consider alternative navigation patterns for more than 7 tabs.
- **Responsive Design**: For mobile views, consider whether tabs remain the best pattern or if another approach (accordion, vertical navigation) would work better.
- **State Persistence**: Consider persisting the selected tab in URL hash or local storage for better user experience.

## Accessibility

- **ARIA Attributes**: Automatically manages `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-labelledby`.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full arrow key navigation following WAI-ARIA best practices:
  - `Arrow Left/Right`: Navigate between tabs
  - `Home/End`: Jump to first/last tab
- **Focus Management**: Only the selected tab is in tab order, improving keyboard navigation efficiency.
- **Browser Search**: Uses `hidden="until-found"` to allow browser find-in-page (Ctrl+F/Cmd+F) to search hidden panels and automatically reveal matching tabs.
