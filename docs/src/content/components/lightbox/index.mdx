A lightbox component that displays images in an immersive full-screen overlay. When clicked, the thumbnail expands to show the full-resolution image with a darkened backdrop,
providing focus on the content while maintaining visual context of the underlying page.

## Examples

### Single Image

Click the image to open it in the lightbox. The lightbox will display the full-resolution image with a backdrop blur effect. Click the close button or press Escape to exit.

<Story id="lightbox--default" />

## Guidelines

- **Use for Focus**: Use lightbox when you want users to focus on visual content without leaving the current page context.

## Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Pressing the Escape key closes the lightbox.
- **Focus Management**: Focus is trapped within the lightbox when open, and returns to the trigger element when closed.
- **Screen Readers**: Images should have descriptive alt text to convey content to screen reader users.
- **Visual Feedback**: The backdrop blur provides clear visual separation between the lightbox and page content.
- **Close Button**: A clearly labeled close button is always visible and accessible.
