The Carousel component allows horizontal scrolling through elements
like images or teasers. It supports features such as snapping,
centered alignment, looping, and keyboard navigation,
making it ideal for compact, scrollable content displays.

<Example code={SomeSliderCode}>
  <div class="w-full">
    <SomeSlider client:only="vue" />
  </div>
</Example>

## Guidelines

Sliders should be used for content that is not easily consumed in a single view. They are ideal for displaying a large amount of content in a compact space.

## Accessibility

When building a Slider, accessibility should not be an afterthought. Ensure that:

- Keyboard navigation is fully supported, allowing users to move between slides using arrow keys.
- Each slide or item is focusable if it contains interactive content.
- ARIA attributes are used to convey structure and behavior.
- Avoid auto-advancing slides unless it’s essential—and always provide a way to pause or control playback.
