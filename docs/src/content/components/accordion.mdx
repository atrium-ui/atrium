import { AccordionDemo } from "./accordion/AccordionDemo.jsx";
import AccordionDemoCode from "./accordion/AccordionDemo.jsx?raw";
import { Example, Atrium } from "package:/components";

## Behaviour

When the accordion is opened or closed, the component makes sure it does not slip out of the viewport by srolling into the viewport.

<Example code={AccordionDemoCode}>
  <AccordionDemo client:only="vue" />
</Example>
